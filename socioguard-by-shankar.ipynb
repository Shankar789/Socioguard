While most are harmless, some can be toxic, harmful, sensitive, or even life-threatening. Moderating such content manually is slow and expensive, and traditional keyword-based filters often fail to understand the nuance behind a post.\nAs a developer passionate about creating safer digital environments, I built a real-time GenAI-powered text moderation system to classify and take appropriate action on harmful posts & Emergency posts‚Ää-‚Ääentirely autonomously, and in seconds.\n\n\nDespite platform efforts, harmful content still makes it through‚Ää-‚Ääfrom bullying and harassment to urgent cries for help.\n  Here's why:\n1. **Manual moderation** can't keep up with the volume of posts being published every second.\n2. **Rule-based systems** are too rigid, missing posts hidden behind slang, emojis, or indirect language.\n3. **Delays in action** can lead to real-world consequences‚Ää-‚Ääfrom mental health impacts to brand damage.\n\nSocial platforms, in particular, require immediate support to detect and automatically respond to:\n* Life-threatening or harmful messages\n* Toxic language and hate speech\n* Sensitive or adult-oriented content\n* Spam, scams, and promotional abuse\n\nThe stakes are high‚Ää-‚Ääuser safety, trust, and platform reputation all hang in the balance.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Solution¬†\n**How GenAI Solves This in Real Time :**\nTo solve this, I built a fully automated GenAI-based moderation pipeline that understands context, tone, risk, and organizational guidelines before taking action.\n\n**Here's how it works Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n* User submits a post.\n* The system retrieves relevant organization guidelines using RAG from ChromaDB.\n* The LLM (Gemini Flash) classifies the post into one of ten categories¬†: LIFE_EMERGENCY, THREAT, HARASSMENT, OFFENSIVE_LANGUAGE, ADULT, SENSITIVE, PRIORITY_SUPPORT, PROMOTIONAL_CONTENT, SPAM, or NORMAL.\n* The model then analyzes‚Ää-‚ÄäPost Tone, Sentiment, Applicable Rule ID¬†,Description¬†, Hashtags and a Risk Score (0.0‚Äì1.0)\n* Based on the risk level and category, a moderation agent decides on the appropriate action:\n\n1. Sanitize harmful, sensitive, offensive statements\n2. Normalize or rephrase hateful & threatening language\n\n* Once a post is analyzed and categorized, it swiftly applies the exact action needed based on the severity of the risk, with zero human delay. Here's how the Action Applier takes command using tools available to it:\n\n  üî¥ Critical: Block the user, Remove post & Send the post for urgent review.\n\n  üü† High: Block the post, temporarily block user (‚â§10 mins), queue for review\n\n  üü° Medium: Temporarily block user (‚â§10 mins) show cleaned version(Sanitize or normalize the post) with/without any review\n\n  ‚ö™ Others: Escalate to emergency, review, or security teams with appropriate priority without any block.\n\n* The system then takes the output from the moderation model and generates a user-friendly explanation, detailing what went wrong and why specific actions were taken.\n\n* The app respects user status such as active, temporarily blocked, or fully blocked, and is designed to operate in real-time (Eg¬†: blocked user can not post anything other then Emergency & High priority support). All post data is stored in SQLite tables, and based on specific flags, the app updates the feed accordingly. Each time a user submits a post, the feed refreshes automatically to display all available posts in real-time.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# üì¶ Installing required packages\nThese are the core libraries powering our GenAI-based moderation system.\n- google-genai: For Gemini model access and tool-calling\n- chromadb: To store and retrieve moderation guidelines using vector search\n- langgraph: For building multi-step agent workflows\n- tabulate: For neat table outputs","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Installing required packages\n!pip install -U -q \"google-genai==1.7.0\"\n!pip install -U -q \"chromadb\"\n!pip install -U -q \"langgraph\"\n!pip install -U -q \"tabulate\"","metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"WSWhFqmCwIQL","jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-13T15:49:10.825364Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-13T15:49:10.825726Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-13T15:49:27.480506Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-13T15:49:10.825698Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-13T15:49:27.479254Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# üì• Importing libraries\nThese modules are essential for building and running our moderation system:\n- Google GenAI: For accessing Gemini models and tool-calling\n- ChromaDB: To handle vector embeddings and store moderation guidelines\n- LangGraph: To create structured agent workflows\n- SQLite3 & datetime: For managing post data and timestamps\n- Tabulate & IPython Display: For pretty outputs and inline visuals\n- Typing & Enum: For data structuring and control flow","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#  Importing libraries\nfrom google.genai import types\nimport typing_extensions as typing\nimport json\nimport enum\nfrom chromadb import Documents, EmbeddingFunction, Embeddings\nfrom google.api_core import retry\nfrom google.genai import types\nimport chromadb\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Optional\nfrom html import unescape\nimport sqlite3\nimport datetime\nfrom google import genai\nfrom IPython.display import HTML, Markdown, display\nfrom google.api_core import retry\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom tabulate import tabulate","metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"cS0DY5MbGh2Z","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-13T15:49:27.482203Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-13T15:49:27.482557Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-13T15:49:29.263695Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-13T15:49:27.482528Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-13T15:49:29.262764Z"},"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# üîê Setting up API Key & Retrying Logic\n - Defines a retry mechanism to handle temporary API errors (e.g., rate limits, service unavailability)\n - Retrieves the Google API key securely using Kaggle secrets\n - Initializes the GenAI client with the authenticated key\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Setting up API Key & Retrying Logic\nis_retriable = lambda e: (isinstance(e, genai.errors.APIError) and e.code in {429, 503})\ngenai.models.Models.generate_content = retry.Retry(\n    predicate=is_retriable)(genai.models.Models.generate_content)\n\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\nGOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n# from google.colab import userdata\n# GOOGLE_API_KEY = userdata.get('GEMINI_KEY')\n\n\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)","metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"5TbVxA_awSEE","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-13T15:49:29.264775Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-13T15:49:29.265364Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-13T15:49:29.617194Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-13T15:49:29.265333Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-13T15:49:29.616129Z"},"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# üß± Defining Core Types and Enums\n* These TypedDicts and Enums define the structure and allowed values for:\n   \n1.

üõ°Ô∏è PostModerationEngine: Full Pipeline for Social Media Post Moderation\nThe PostModerationEngine class is the central engine that drives the entire moderation workflow in the Social Media Posts Monitor and Controller system. It ties together the different moderation services, orchestrating the entire process from post validation to user notification. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its components and flow:\n\nService Initialization:\nThe MonitorService is instantiated to handle core moderation tasks like validating posts, categorizing them, and performing content normalization and sanitization.\n\nGraph-Oriented Workflow:\nThe moderation flow is structured as a State Graph, where each node represents a critical step in the moderation pipeline:\n\n* GateKeeper: Validates the user post, checking for necessary fields and formatting.\n* InsightEngine: Uses AI models to classify the post based on category, tone, sentiment, and risk.\n* Sanitize: Sanitizes the post for sensitive content when necessary.\n* Normalize: Normalizes content to ensure clarity and prevent misunderstanding.\n* JusticeNode: Determines whether any moderation actions are needed, like blocking or escalating the post.\n* VoiceBox: Sends feedback to the user, notifying them of moderation outcomes.\n\nConditional Routing:\nThe flow uses conditional edges to dynamically determine the next step based on the post‚Äôs category (e.g., sensitive content may trigger sanitization).\n\nFinal Output:\nThe main method is the entry point to invoke the moderation flow. It takes a post_data string as input, runs it through the entire pipeline, and outputs the final feedback response for the user.\n\nGraph Visualization:\nThe get_graph() method generates a visual representation of the moderation workflow using Mermaid diagrams, providing an easy-to-understand map of the entire process.\n\nThis structured approach ensures a dynamic and flexible moderation system that can handle a wide range of social media posts, making it suitable for real-time content moderation at scale.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#PostModerationEngine: Full Pipeline for Social Media Post Moderation\nclass PostModerationEngine:\n    service = MonitorService()\n    graph = StateGraph(ModerationState)\n    \n    graph.add_node(\"GateKeeper\", service.validate_user_post)\n    graph.add_node(\"InsightEngine\", service.get_post_category)\n    graph.add_node(\"Sanitize\", service.sanitize_user_post)\n    graph.add_node(\"Normalize\", service.normalize_user_post)\n    graph.add_node(\"JusticeNode\", service.take_actions_based_on_analysis)\n    graph.add_node(\"VoiceBox\", service.review_action_applied_and_notify_user)\n    \n    graph.set_entry_point(\"GateKeeper\")\n    graph.add_edge(\"GateKeeper\", \"InsightEngine\")\n    graph.add_conditional_edges(\"InsightEngine\", service.route_after_categorization)\n    graph.add_edge(\"Sanitize\", \"JusticeNode\")\n    graph.add_edge(\"Normalize\", \"JusticeNode\")\n    graph.add_edge(\"JusticeNode\", \"VoiceBox\")\n    graph.add_edge(\"VoiceBox\", END)\n    graph\n    social_media_monitor_app = graph.compile()\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def main(post_data:str):\n        try:\n          result = PostModerationEngine.social_media_monitor_app.invoke({\"user_post\": user_post})\n          response = json.loads(result[\"final_output\"])\n          print(\"Post Response :\\n\"+response.get(\"final_response_to_user_on_post_submission\")+\"\\n\\n\")\n          PrintDataFromDataBase.print_post_data()\n        except ValueError as e:\n          print(e)\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_graph():\n        from IPython.display import Image, display\n        graph = PostModerationEngine.social_media_monitor_app.get_graph()\n        display(Image(graph.draw_mermaid_png()))","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":0},"cellView":"form","id":"OMRIMpDDL6nR","outputId":"d39a70e2-6d73-4c8c-8354-669311f416bf","jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-13T15:49:29.792156Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-13T15:49:29.792445Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-13T15:49:30.942205Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-13T15:49:29.792424Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-13T15:49:30.941298Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Initializing the application\nInitializing Gemini emdeding function\nInitializing the database service\ncreated required tables - done\nUpdated chroma db with latest organisation policy\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"üìù Testing the PostModerationEngine with a Sample Post\nLet's run the PostModerationEngine on a real-world example to see how it handles moderation tasks such as post validation, categorization, and taking appropriate actions.\n\nsample input = \n\n> {\n> \"user_name\": \"King\",\n> \"post_txt\": \"Hello everyone, I am in india, what a hevenly land\"\n> }\n\nsample output =\n\n* post response :\n* All Avilable Feed Post:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Testing the PostModerationEngine with a Sample Post\nuser_post = \"\"\"\n{\n  \"user_name\": \"King\",\n  \"post_txt\": \"Hello everyone, I am in india, what a hevenly land\"\n}\n\"\"\"\nPostModerationEngine.main(user_post)\n# PostModerationEngine.get_graph()","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":0},"id":"HVkq6I73wWib","outputId":"5ba7fd94-563c-4b1b-a71a-7dcd894671ec","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-13T15:49:30.943116Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-13T15:49:30.943436Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-13T15:49:32.912738Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-13T15:49:30.943397Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-13T15:49:32.911676Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Post Response :\nHey KING, your post is visible.
